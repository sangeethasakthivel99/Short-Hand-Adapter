# Short-Hand-Adapter
Goal: Reduce the boiler plate code of recycler view adapter

We implement RecyclerView in our Android Application when we need to display a list and we do know that for presenting list data in RecyclerView needs RecyclerViewAdapter.
Usually, us developers create different adapter classes for each recycler view, as a result of that generating boilerplate code. When we have more than one recycler view in our app, we can use a single adapter class which allows all types of data. By doing that we simplify creating RecyclerView adapters and avoid writing boilerplate code.
